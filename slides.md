- Containers are used to center and constrain the layout width
- Grids and Columns allow us to create flexible and responsive layouts by dividing the page into rows and columns

- Goto: https://codepen.io/codevilla/pen/OPJbdzQ
- READ https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/

<!-- 
- show common breakpoints (sm, md, lg...)
